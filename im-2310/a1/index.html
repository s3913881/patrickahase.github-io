                    <ul>
                        <li>When visiting this site for the first time, I found it very interesting with its functions and displayed projects. But as I spent more time exploring it, I began to realize that it had multiple levels or stages, each requiring multiple visits to complete. Also, this site may be regularly updated or new content added, which makes me want to come back and check back. After many visits, I gradually became familiar with its navigation and functions, and was able to browse and study more effectively. So, this interactive experience seems to imply that we interact with it over time and may need multiple visits or frequent checks in order to fully appreciate the content and functionality it has to offer.</li>
