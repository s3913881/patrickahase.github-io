        <p>My chosen pairing principle is “Translucent“ and ”Feedback“.
            When I see the word 'Translucent', I imagine the moon and clouds in the night sky, intertwined and creating a mysterious and enchanting image. I think it might be possible to describe this scene as 'Translucent.'</p>
        <p>The website has a black background with a bright moon hovering in the centre. The moon will be obscured by multiple clouds to create a translucent effect. Users can freely drag the clouds and adjust their position to control the visibility of the moon. By adjusting the level of cloud shading, users can freely control the screen brightness or the website brightness.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>About Translucent</h4>
        <li>Translucent cloud images: the user can see the moon and the night sky through the clouds. The site uses transparency as a design element as I wanted to mimic the effect people see in reality at night.</p>
        <li>Translucent text box: this allows the text box to be displayed when the user scrolls down the mouse wheel. The user can still see the night view through the text box. This is because the site contains textual content and I wanted the night scene and text sections to work well together, making the text box translucent reduces the prominence of the text section.</p>
        <h4>About Feedback</h4>
        <li>Interaction alert: When the user drags the clouds, the clouds zoom in and the mouse cursor changes to direct the user's attention and engagement. I hope this design will enhance the user's interactive experience and also make it easier for the user to understand the effect of their actions.</p>
        <li>Drag and drop functionality: The user can freely drag and drop the clouds to interact with the moon.</p>
        <li>Brightness change: The site will adjust the brightness of the whole page according to the change in the area of the clouds overlapping the moon. The more overlapping areas there are, the darker the page becomes. This provides the user with an immediate visual feedback.</p>
        <h4>Other Designs</h4>
        <li>The initial position of the clouds: I have placed the initial position of the clouds in different parts of the page and made them relatively evenly spaced. I hope that the user will have a good visual experience when they first enter the site.</p>
        <li>Cloud panning: When users enter the site they can see the clouds moving to the right at a slow speed. This is also intended to mimic the feeling of seeing clouds in the present day and hopefully enhance the realism of the user experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, as I spent too much time on the calculation of the overlapping area of the clouds and the moon, there are some aspects of this website that could be improved. First, to improve the user experience, drag-and-drop borders could be set to ensure that users are more convenient and comfortable in adjusting the brightness. Sometimes there is a bug that the brightness does not change after refreshing the page. All in all, I really enjoyed the process of making this site. It was a great experience to use what I had learned to make the ideas in my head come to life!</p>
